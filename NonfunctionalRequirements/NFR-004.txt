[James Gallagher] I think your fit criteria is spot on. This is very much within the jurisdiction of the legal team/representation and only they, as domain experts, can confirm whether the product complies. 

[David Jakes] Looks good to me.  I suspect any card related legislation or standard (eg PCI DSS) would be inapplicable because the actual transaction will be conducted by an adjacent system.

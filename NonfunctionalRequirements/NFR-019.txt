REQ-ID: NFR-019
Description: The product shall meet data security compliance standards, such as PCI-DSS.
Type: 17, Legal
Rationale: This ensures that a cardholderï¿½s data is protected and maintained through a secure network. PCI-DSS is the industry standard.
Fit Criterion 1: As the WIMS is handling smaller volumes, a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) document is required to be completed each and every year and submit to the transaction Bank.
Fit Criterion 2: Store digital recordings that include sensitive card data won't be able to be queried
Originator: Justin and Marion
Comments: [David Perez] The actual transaction will be conducted by an adjacent system but the billing information collected has to meet the interface specs to the adjacent system.
[Tim Holmes-Mitra] MRP page 295 suggests that for legal NFRs the fit criteria should include a review by the company's lawyers. In this instance, it would be useful to have the lawyers discuss with the software company to ensure data is protected before it's handed off to the third party as David suggests.  Additionally, it might also include confirmation that the third party adheres to UK data security standards.

### TMA03/Q2a FR Discussion [1900 GMT 13 Mar 17]
The Google Hangouts discussion link is [here](https://hangouts.google.com/call/hapf3mtftvculd26urpr5vsk54e).

The aim of this discussion is:
* To reach consensus on the WIMS functional requirements set.
* To remove duplicates by consensus.
* To amend ambiguous wording.

The proposed format is:

1. Work through requirements in ascending numerical order. So please come prepared to propose duplicates.
2. Spend no more than 5 minutes discussing each.
3. If consensus does not emerge naturally, then a vote will resolve conflicts. In the event of a tie, the requirement will remain in the specification.
4. Once all requirements have been reviewed, duplicates removed, and amendments made, the requirements will be merged with the master branch.

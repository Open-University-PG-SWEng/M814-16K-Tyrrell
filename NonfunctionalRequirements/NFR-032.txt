[Archie Campbell] - duplicate of NFR-004,020.

[Tim Holmes-Mitra] NFRs 004/020 and 032 all relate to the DPA.  I think 004 is  different in that it deals with banking information, whereas 020 is a duplicate of this one.  I'm not sure how to deal with the conflict. Do we proceed in refining them and then approve/disprove the NFR down the line, or do we resolve the conflicts by choosing a different NFR now?

[Tony Cornwall] Revised the NFR

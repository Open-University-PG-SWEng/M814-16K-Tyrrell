REQ-ID: 018
Description: The product shall be efficient and easy to use.
Type: Usability (check this)
Rationale: To ensure user adoption of the system
Fit Criterion: Users should be able to successfully access membership, reservations, payments and plan activites on their first attempt. A request for a record should return a response in less than 0.5s.
Originator: Justin and Marion

[David Jakes] This might be better separated into two discrete non-functional requirements.  Sharp et alia (2207) suggest six usability goals:
	utility
	efficiency
	effectiveness
	safety
	learnability
	memorability
Efficiency is on its own, but the last two contribute to ease of use.  They can be measured in different ways.
Nothing is cast in stone of course, but your fit criterion actually includes two measurable criteria, and, since your requirement seems to cover at least four use cases, a huge amount of testing will be involved.
Also, who are the users?  Centre customers might be able to access their own membership details, but they are unlikely to use the system as regularly as staff members, so I think there needs to be some caution with the metrics.  Currently, you are implying that 100% of users are successful on their first attempt.  The specification is likely to become part of a contract.  That's a big ask.  Nielsen (2001) has a useful discussion on metrics.
I think measuring the response time is really a performance non-functional requirement, although certainly it must contribute to efficiency.

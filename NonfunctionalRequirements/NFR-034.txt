REQ-ID: 034
Description: The payment receipt records kept by the system shall be up to date.
Type: Performance
Rationale: Since reports will need to be generated on a daily basis, the records of payments receipts need to be
            updated frequently so that the daily report will contain the previous day's complete set of payments.
Fit Criterion: Any new payments made, are available within the receipt payments collection within 10 minutes maximum.

[Tim Holmes-Mitra] It might be worth reworking your description to align with the recommended MRP structure of "The product shall keep payment receipt records up to date".  Additionally, the payment system is an adjacent system and so we may not control how quickly it produces payment confirmations.  I think your NFR is valid though, and I'm not sure if anything needs to be changed. The WIMS could note that a user attempted payment and display  'confirmation pending' until the adjacent system returns the receipt, for example.

[Tony Cornwall] The description is a bit ambiguous as I was not sure if the payment receipt or record should be up to date, however your Rationale and Fit Criterion do clarify this.  

[Archie Campbell] To make development of the tests for this fit criterion more simple, might it be better to specify a maximum length of receipt document and a minimum length of payment collection for the required throughput? We are essentially testing the bandwidth of the receipt records system, and here a more specifically generic fit criterion might serve the developers better.

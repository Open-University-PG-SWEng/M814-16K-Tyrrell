REQ-ID: 023
Description: Product shall allow generate reports only to users with correct permissions assigned.
Type: Security
Rationale: Product will take care of multiple user types - authenticated user, user with membership, volunteers, administrators etc. We need to make sure, that only users with certain permission can generate reports.
Fit Criterion: Register multiple user types, with different types of permissions assigned and try to generate reports. Product should disallow this task.

[James Gallagher] It might be worth having acceptance criteria satisfying both an accepted as well as a rejected request. When you say 'multiple user types', you could be more verbose. For example, administrator, manager and finance user types should have access to the report. Anonymous, sales and reception users should receive security alert. It may also be worthwhile to log all failed attempts.

[Adrian Potter] As James suggests, the fit criterion should be specific and mesaurable. In its current form, it would be satisfied if regular users could create reports but administrators couldn't.

[David Perez] In my opinion the description and the fit criterion are misaligned because the fit criterion implies to test a system level solution rather than testing directly a invalid permission access. 
 +              Perhaps the fit criterion should be rephrase in order to specify that the generation of reportes is not allowed rather than being reactive to it.

[Constantinos Morfakis] To add to David Perez's I would suggest an ammendment to the current Fit Criterion to something
                        like:
                       "Out of 100 successful report generations, none will have originated from a user without the proper permissions"

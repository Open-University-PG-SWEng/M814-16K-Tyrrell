[James Gallagher] It might be worth having acceptance criteria satisfying both an accepted as well as a rejected request. When you say 'multiple user types', you could be more verbose. For example, administrator, manager and finance user types should have access to the report. Anonymous, sales and reception users should receive security alert. It may also be worthwhile to log all failed attempts.

[Adrian Potter] As James suggests, the fit criterion should be specific and mesaurable. In its current form, it would be satisfied if regular users could create reports but administrators couldn't.

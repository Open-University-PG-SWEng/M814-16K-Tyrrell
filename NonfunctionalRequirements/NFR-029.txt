REQ-ID: 029
Description: System is identified on a trusted SSL certificate.
Type: Security requirement
Rationale: Secured HTTPS is required to secure the communications with whichever system for charging the credit card is devised.
Fit Criterion: HTTPS is possible to and from the relevant WIMS subsystem using a trusted SSL provider bundle.
Originator: Archie Campbell
Comments: 
[Archie Campbell] HTTPS communication is required to prevent unsecured man in the middle attacks of various kinds during the charge session with the credit card operator.

[Tony Cornwall] I would remove the technological elements (SSL,HTTPS) from the NFR. Try something like this "The product shall prevent unauthorized communications in the WIMS subsystem"

[TR] I completely agree with [Tony Cornwall], requirements should be generic and in fact SSL is dying and we should not bound it

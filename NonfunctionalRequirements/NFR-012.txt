REQ-ID: 12
Description: The product shall render discovery of workshop place availability easy for centre staff and the general public.
Type: Usability and humanity (11)
Rationale: The rationale for functional requirement REQ-ID 12 relates to the continued viability of the business, and its potential expansion.  In support of the latter, the clients wish to
											enable a more efficient use of facilities
											reduce the (manual) administrative work
											reduce the numbers of errors in facility and workshop bookings.
The product must be easy to use by centre staff.
Currently, to book a workshop place, a member of the public telephones the centre, and, having checked place availability, the staff-member who takes the call makes the booking.  In a future business use case, a member of the general public might have responsibility for making their own booking.  Therefore this requirement applies to all types of user. 
Fit Criterion: Having identified a workshop of interest, 9 out of 10 of users shall perform the necessary steps to determine place availability for that workshop within 15 seconds.

[Gavin Sore] No detail has been given on when the NFR will be tested, is it to a test group if so who are in the test group, or is it all users over a given period? I believe the gold plating relating to future access of the general public is mudding the waters here.

[David Perez] So far, it is the best fit criterion I have assigned for the group NFRs. However, I wonder whether you should be more specific about "the necessary steps to". What are these steps?
